# CodeCube
###### An MVC framework inspired by Laravel without the steep learning curve.
This framework is helpful for PHP newcomers who are looking forward to start coding in Laravel. Due to familiar coding in a similar structure to Laravel framework, it will be easier for a PHP beginner to adopt this framework, learn about basic framework structures and get into Laravel later on.
