# CodeCube
###### An MVC framework inspired by Laravel minus the steep learning curve.
This framework is helpful for PHP newcomers who are trying to get into Laravel. Due to familiar PHP coding in a similar structure to Laravel framework, it will be easier for a PHP beginner to adopt this framework, learn about basic framework structures and shift into Laravel later on.
